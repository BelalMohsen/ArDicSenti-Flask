## Project overView
1. At first we try to get the raw of words because in arabic there are many words that has more than one meaning so we make steming for all words and try to use an algorithm to see the probablity of this word `How Much` it positive or negative or missleading or Senseless  . 
2. And after doing this we work with users Contributions , As user can say this word seems to be positive so the positive percentage will growth Up and so on . 
3. Now we come to the Download Stage You Choose the percentages of words that you want to download and you can Make A Threshold to Votes in Words you need .
